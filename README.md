# `WHAT I LEARNED IN WEEK 6`


## `String Interpolation`

```
${firstName} is ${age} years old and ${occupation} at a hospital. 
```
---
## `Bump Up`

* num = num + 1
* num +
* num + =
* num ++
  
-----

### `Bump Down`

* num = num - 1
* num --
* num - = 

--- 
## `Filtering Loops`
```
function evensOnly(max){
    let num = 2
    while(num <= max) {
        if (num%2 === 0){
            console.log(num)}
        } num = num + 2
    }
```  

---
## `Repeating Strings`
```
str.repeat(n) -> repeats the string n times

str.replace('o' , 'a')  -> replace o with a.

'Colin'.replace('o' , 'a').repeat(3) -> replaces 'o' with an 'a' and repeats for 3 times. 

-> 'CalinCalinCalin'

'Colin'.repeat(3).replace('o' , 'a')->  repeats the string for 3 times and then replaces 'o' with an 'a'.

-> 'ColinColinCalin'
```

## `Human Resource Machine`

Fibonacci was very hard. I spent more than 2 hours figuring out how to do it. I think HRM is getting very hard and challenging. However, I can see what it is teaching us in a better way. I hope it won't get that hard!! Looking forward to finish the game.

---
## `.includes`
```
let greeting = 'hello'
if greeting.includes('z'){
    console.log('yep')}
else {
    console.log('try again')}
```
```
let currentCharacter =  str[i];
if ('aeiou').includes(currentCharacter){
    console.log(currentCharacter)}

```
